// This file is ready for your custom JavaScript.

// You can add interactivity to your website here.
// For example:
// 1. A "scroll to top" button that appears after scrolling down the page.
// 2. Animations that make the cards fade in as they enter the viewport.
// 3. A modal window to display the bibliography instead of linking to a new page.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Your code goes here.
    // This event listener ensures your code runs only after the
    // entire HTML document has been loaded and parsed.
    console.log("Website loaded and ready for interaction!");
});
